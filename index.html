    <p>Nowadays, we hear a lot of people moving towards vegetarianism - from celebrities to models and to a lot of health enthusiasts. For years there has been an on-going debate on whether or not a vegetarian diet is healthy and aids weight loss. A Vegetarian diet can be divided into three parts that is - total vegetarian, lacto vegetarian and lacto-ovo vegetarian. A pure vegetarian diet includes fruits, nuts, vegetables, fruits, grains, and legumes. The lacto vegetarian diet contains dairy products like milk, butter, cheese etc., and plant food. According to the Delhi based nutritionist, Pooja Malhotra, ''the lacto-vegetarian diets are very practical, easy to plan, wholesome diets.They certainly help in losing weight without compromising on nutrients. These are recommended for both adults and kids. '' On the other hand, lacto-ovo vegetarian food includes eggs and dairy products like milk, butter, cheese and so on. No doubt a vegetarian diet is full of vitamins and minerals, fiber, magnesium, unsaturated fat and folic acid. Such diet protects us from various diseases like diabetes, heart diseases, controls blood pressure, and prevents us from cancer and lower cholesterol levels. A non-vegetarian diet includes chicken, meat, eggs and fish. A non-vegetarian diet also has several health benefits because this type of food is rich in protein and vitamin B. Non-vegetarian food strengthens our muscles and helps them grow faster. It also helps to maintain body stamina and hemoglobin.
